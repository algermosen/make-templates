# Make Templates

I'm tired of having to go back to projects to remember what I put into my makefiles. Also is something I'm planning to show others so they can see the capabilities of makefiles.

This repository contains makefile examples I use in my projects. They have comments explaining what's the usage for the provided processes, configuration variables and in-process variables
